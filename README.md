# TLDTests
Simple front ends for feature testing (plain JS, no Angular)

Relevant files are view, compose, and home.

Each of the three html pages has its own stylesheet. Even though they share many of the same elements (i.e. "logo"), it doesn't mean that the "logo" element refers to the same thing on all of the html pages, since there are different versions of logos (big logo, small logo, logo before the letter, logo after the letter, etc). 

Also, certain elements belong to one class but I redefined their styles again later in the CSS page to override a specific previous style -therefore the ordering on CSS page matters (sorry it's such a mess).
